            <p class="body-copy"> True to his famous motto, the Berlin airlift buck did stop with President Harry Truman; he had to decide whether to risk war by breaking the Soviet blockade on land or approving an unprecedented effort to supply a city by air. </p>

<p class="body-copy"> Berlin was more than 100 miles within the Soviet zone, and many of Truman's advisers thought the only U.S. course was to pull out of the city. Allied troops were vastly outnumbered there, supplies were limited, <span id="inset-1"> <img src="images/img-western-allies-2.png" width="295" height="396" alt="general"/> </span> and any airlift would strain U.S. obligations elsewhere. But Truman would not back down: "We stay in Berlin -- period." He ordered additional transports to Germany and B-29 bomber squadrons to England so Stalin knew the U.S. meant business. </p>

<p class="body-copy"> That did not mean the president was eager for a shooting war, though; when the American commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, advocated breaking the Soviet blockade with an armed ground convoy, Truman refused. Berlin would be supplied in a less provocative manner, from the air. The wisdom of Truman's decision was borne out less than a year later when Stalin abandoned his blockade without the Americans and Soviets exchanging a shot.</p>

            <p class="body-copy"> When it became clear that the blockade would last more than a few weeks, the Air Force flew in William "Tonnage" Tunner. As the commander of the then largest airlift in history, Tunner was the uncontested air supply expert. On his first day, Tunner discovered that the crews wasted a lot of time returning with their lunch from the airport terminal. He had jeeps converted into mobile snack bars and had "beautiful German frauleins" bring the pilots refreshments and clearance papers while the planes were being unloaded and refueled. With these changes in effect, a C-54 would be ready for takeoff only 30 minutes after it landed. After two months of operation, over 1500 flights landed in Berlin every day with enough cargo to supply the city indefinitely. </p>

<p class="body-copy"> At its peak, the airlift delivered more supplies than the trains before the blockade, with a new plane landing every 30 seconds in Berlin. “Valuable time was wasted in Berlin as crews landed, parked, shut off engines, took off for the snack bar and then strolled over to Operations to make out their return clearances. <span id="inset-2"> <img src="images/img-western-allies-3.png" width="398" height="296" alt="Tunner"/> <span class="text-content"><span>“We can keep on pouring it in for 20 years if we have to.” - General William Tunner USAF</span></span></span> I laid down an order: No crew member was to leave the side of his aircraft while the Germans unloaded it. Each plane would be met by an operations officer who would hand the pilot his return clearance all filled out, and a weather officer would give him the latest weather back at his home base. Mobile snack bars tended by some of the most beautiful girls in Berlin would move to the side of each plane. Turn-around time was cut in half to 30 minutes.”
